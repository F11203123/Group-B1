Overview:
- This documentation provides an overview of tasks relevant to operating and optimizing the Epson robotic arm.


### Task 1: Pick and place

During this task the EPSON robot arm is set to pick three different tokens and three different blocks and place them in a tray.

  - Procedure:
    - STEP 1: Pick the token from the feeder
    - STEP 2: Align the token using the alignment feature
    - STEP 3: PLace the token in its corresponding place in the tray
    - Step 4: Follow the previous steps for the blocks

### Task 2: Token Stacking

During this task the EPSON robot arm is set to stack 10 tokens and 10 blocs on top of each other alternately.

  - Procedure
    - STEP 1: Pick a block from the feeder and place it in an specific point.
    - STEP 2: Pick a token a place it on top of the block
    - STEP 3: Repeat the process for the remaining pieces

### Task 3: Project

### I/O BOX Configuration

The I/O Box configuration is an important tool while working with EPSON robot arms, therefore, the following configuration is set for every task of this course:

  - üü¢**GREEN BUTTON**: Start the program
  - üî¥**RED BUTTON** Emergency stop
  - üîµ**BLUE BUTTON**: Pause the program
  - ‚ö™Ô∏è**WHITE BUTTON**: Resume program
  - üü†**ORANGE BUTTON**: Go home
